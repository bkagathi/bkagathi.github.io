### **What I did?**

During my time researching at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I worked under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student within the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My main objective centered around nanotechnology and its application to Ga2O3 power devices; I was responsible for both understanding as well as educating my team on all new developments regarding these power devices.

I gained skills working with academic databases and understanding complex research publications. I was able to extract key information and create easily digestible summaries for my mentor to evaluate.

In addition to my introduction to research, I was able to actively apply my knowledge to contribute to the creation of testing material to physically manifest the concepts that I had been reading about. Given specifications, I had the opportunity to create masks for various phone and computer chip designs which my mentor used as a template for chip fabrication. Furthermore, I was given exposure to the technical process of the physical creation of power devices in a clean room.


### **Why I did it?**

My initial interest in this internship sparked from my curiosity in nanotechnology. I hoped to learn more about its real-world applications and current active developments. I wanted to explore the fields of electrical and computer engineering while actively contributing to a larger project. I also intended to gain exposure and skills in regard to the steps of researching in an academic setting that would help me in the future. 


### **What I used?**

- Klayout
- Academic Databases 

### **Outcome**

From this experience, I gained skills in parsing complex research for key information as well as learned basic technical skills relating to the development of Ga2O3 power devices.
