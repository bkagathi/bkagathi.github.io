### **What was the project?**

The inspiration for this project stemmed from the overuse of looking down at phones while crossing busy streets or biking in large cities. Our idea was to tackle one cause of this problem, people having to look down at their phone when looking at directions. 

Our solution was creating a piece that would fit under your shoelaces and notify you directions such as “turn right”, “turn left”, “turn around” through vibrational technology. 

Our prototype consisted of a Bluetooth capable Arduino in a custom Cadded case. We added vibrational motors and modules that were attached to the Arduino and concealed within our case. We implemented simple functionalities such as vibrate right foot when needing to turn right and vibrate left foot when needing to turn left. 

### **What I did?**

One of my major contributions included brainstorming a unique problem to solve and looking at various approaches and applications for solutions. This involved researching various problems affecting people at the time and evaluating the functionality of various solutions that came to mind. 

During the process of developing a small prototype I learned how to use CAD (fusion 360) to create a case that would fit perfectly to the dimensions of the Arduino and the vibrational pieces that would be added. Furthermore, I worked with the Arduino IDE software to program the device; I created various vibrational patterns that would be able to signal different directions needed. 

I was also able to get more comfortable using a Bluetooth Arduino and understanding the meaning of the various pins it contains. In order to attach our vibrating technology to our Arduino, I was also introduced to the soldering process. 

### **Why I did it?**

With the pure interest of going through the entire process of creating my own product, I went into creating these smart shoes prototype with a few of my friends. I wanted to build something that would solve a real problem and implement a project that I could envision others using. I also hoped to explore my curiosity in hardware and also teach myself some new skills.
