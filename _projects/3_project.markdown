### **What is the project?**

With a large trend in thrifting for clothes sparking over the last few years, we saw the need to create an online platform that imitates the ability of reselling clothing. Our current developing application provides the ability for users to create “closets” where they can sell their clothing at their preferred price and also have the ability to bid on clothing other users are selling. 

You can visit Upstyle's landing page [here](https://upstyle.app).

### **What I am doing?**

My main role in creating this application is designing all the screens that will be encompassed in the app. Furthermore, I am learning to code in Flutter where I have so far been able to implement some of the designs I have created. Furthermore, I was able to assist in creating a landing page with our designs where we could begin to gauge interest in the app itself.  

I also work on figuring out and researching various aspects that may needed in our application in order to be successful and easy for a consumer to use. 

### **Why I am doing it?**

The purpose of creating this application was to feed my interest in creating a product that could be effective in this large transition to completely online businesses. I also wanted to learn some new programming languages and learn how to create apps.
