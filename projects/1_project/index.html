  <article class="post-content Internship @ UIC clearfix">
    <h3 id="what-i-did"><strong>What I did?</strong></h3>

<p>During my time researching at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I worked under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student within the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My main objective centered around nanotechnology and its application to Ga2O3 power devices; I was responsible for both understanding as well as educating my team on all new developments regarding these power devices.</p>

<p>I gained skills working with academic databases and understanding complex research publications. I was able to extract key information and create easily digestible summaries for my mentor to evaluate.</p>

<p>In addition to my introduction to research, I was able to actively apply my knowledge to contribute to the creation of testing material to physically manifest the concepts that I had been reading about. Given specifications, I had the opportunity to create masks for various phone and computer chip designs which my mentor used as a template for chip fabrication. Furthermore, I was given exposure to the technical process of the physical creation of power devices in a clean room.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-did-it"><strong>Why I did it?</strong></h3>

<p>My initial interest in this internship sparked from my curiosity in nanotechnology. I hoped to learn more about its real-world applications and current active developments. I wanted to explore the fields of electrical and computer engineering while actively contributing to a larger project. I also intended to gain exposure and skills in regard to the steps of researching in an academic setting that would help me in the future.</p>

  <li>Klayout</li>
  <li>Academic Databases</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcome"><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>

<p>From this experience, I gained skills in parsing complex research for key information as well as learned basic technical skills relating to the development of Ga2O3 power devices.</p>
