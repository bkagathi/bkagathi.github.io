I am currently studying Bioengineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My interests primarily lie within its subfields of imaging and sensing as well as computational and systems biology. Currently I am intrigued in looking more into medical devices and data driven medicine. I am open to exploring new fields as well and greatly enjoy gaining new perspective and knowledge.

As of 2020, I serve as an active leader in Engineering Council where I hold leadership positions in the *EXPO* (engineering career fair), *EOB* (engineering outreach bureau), and Corporate committees. I am also an active member of Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional business fraternity where I have developed a tremendous amount of professional interaction experience and networking skills. 

Please check out some of my past and current projects. Feel free to contact me or find out more about me through my various social medias linked below!
